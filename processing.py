def translate(video_file):
    """
    Translate Chinese text extracted from frames of a video.

    Args:
    - video_file (str): Path to the input video file.

    Procedure:
    1. Determines the name of the folder containing frames and the associated CSV file based on the video's filename.
    2. Initializes the Chinese OCR tool and the Google translator.
    3. Iterates through each frame image in the designated folder.
    4. Uses OCR to extract Chinese text from the image.
    5. Transforms the extracted text to its Pinyin representation.
    6. Translates the Chinese text to English. If translation fails, it retries up to 5 times.
    7. Saves the Chinese text, its Pinyin, and its English translation to the CSV file.
    8. If the Chinese text in a frame matches the text in the previous frame, reuses the Pinyin and translation from the previous frame.
    9. After processing all frames, the directory containing the frames is deleted.
    10. Outputs statistics on the number of characters attempted for translation and the actual number of characters translated.
